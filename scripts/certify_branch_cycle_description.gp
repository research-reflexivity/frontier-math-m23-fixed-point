\\ The V-discriminant factors as T^8 (T^2+23)^92 G^2 with deg G = 84.
\\ The three parts have completely different meanings:
\\
\\   T^8          eight simple ramification points; T does not divide the
\\                singular locus, so these are smooth points of the plane
\\                model and the fibre type at T=0 is 1^7 2^8, class 2A;
\\   (T^2+23)     the Newton polygon at this place is a single segment of
\\                slope 4/23 with gcd(4,23)=1, so the local extension is
\\                totally ramified of degree 23: a 23-cycle at each of the
\\                two conjugate geometric points T = +-sqrt(-23);
\\   G^2          exponent two and contained in the singular locus.  This
\\                certificate locates 84 singular fibres; the assertion
\\                that they are ordinary nodes comes from the companion
\\                optimal-model singular-scheme computation.

\\ Riemann-Hurwitz then gives 2g-2 = -46 + 8 + 22 + 22 = 6, genus four.
